	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Replicate THIS!</h1>
	<p class="intro"><b>Howdy!</b> I'm Kelsi West. I'm a DIY enthusiast and that applies to all parts of my life, including my career as a Bioinformatics Scientist.</p>
    <p>In my field, I find that communication and reproducibility is severely lacking. I want to help change this.</p>
    <p>So here is where I share my personal attempts of going through tutorials I find, making notes🗒️, fixing errors🤞🏻, and trying to successfully📈 recapitulate code or tutorials that are out there in the wild.</p>
    <p>I deal with simple installations of software to full-on analysis of complex biological datasets.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Let's make everything <b>reproducible</b>. It starts with <b>clear communication</b>!</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>My system: MacBook M3 Pro, 36GB Memory, macOS Sonoma v14.4.</p>
    <p>I use Pycharm Community Edition for my IDE with Python 3.12 (depending on codebase).</p>
