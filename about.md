		<li>Howdy! I'm Kelsi West. I'm a DIY enthusiast and that applies to all parts of my life, including my career as a Bioinformatics Scientist.</li>
        <li>In my field, I find that communication and reproducibility is severely lacking. I want to help change this.</li>
        <li>So here is where I share my personal attempts of going through tutorials I find, making notes🗒️, fixing errors🤞🏻, and trying to successfully📈 recapitulate code or tutorials that are out there in the wild.</li>
        <li>I deal with simple installations of software to full-on analysis of complex biological datasets.</li>
        <li>Let's make everything reproducible. It starts with clear communication!</li>
